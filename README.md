# React Native Coding Challenge

### Task Overview

Build a mobile movie app using React Native with Expo. The app will display a list of movies and allow users to view detailed information about each one. You’ll use React Expo router to handle screen transitions and fetch movie data locally or from an API.

### Example workflow

- Movies screen (These movie API calls don’t need to be protected with JWT.)
    - Use a public API of your choice to fetch movie data. https://www.themoviedb.org/
    - List of movie posters, titles, release dates.
    - A movie details screen when a user taps on a movie.

### **Technical requirements**

- Framework & Language
    - Use React Native with Expo.
    - Use Expo router.
    - Use Typescript.
- Core features:
    - Use Expo router for screen routing.
    - Navigate to the Movie screen to browse and view available movies.
    - Fetch public movie data from a free movie API (e.g., TMDB or [OMDb](https://www.omdbapi.com/)).
    - Display:
        - Poster image
        - Movie title
        - Release date
    - Include a details screen for each movie with more information.
    - Users can just get redirected to the trailer link. Would be nice if they can play the video inside the app.

### Git & Commit

- Use Git for version control throughout the project.
- Commits must be clear and meaningful.

### README Instructions

Please include:

- How to run the app.
- A short explanation of how you implemented movie browsing and navigation between screens.
- Any decisions, challenges, or bugs you faced.

## **Rules:**

- Finish the assignment within one week (note there is some flexibility on this but the role may be filled if you finish too late).
- Ensure you understand the code you write, as you will be asked questions about it during the interview.
- Do NOT use AI to write your code! Vibe coding is not allowed.
- Complete the work independently; do not seek outside help.

## **Evaluation Criteria**

1. **Mobile App Functionality**: Is the app intuitive and functional?
2. **Code Quality**: Is the code clean, modular, and well-documented?
3. **Efficiency**: Is the app performant for the scope of the task?
4. **Commit History**: Are there clear and logical commits showing progress?
5. **Creativity**: Have you implemented any optional features or unique enhancements?
6. **Aesthetics:** Is it visually pleasing? Does the UI look nice?
7. **Security:** Are you following best practices for security (ex: not exposing API keys in the browser)?

## **Submission Instructions:**

1. Push your code to a **public GitHub repository**.
2. Include a **README** with:
    - Setup instructions for running the app locally.
    - Details on configuring environment variables.
    - Any assumptions or limitations in your implementation.
3. Email the link to your repository along with any relevant notes to [recruiting@pioneerdev.ai](mailto:recruiting@pioneerdev.ai) and cc [steve@pioneerdev.ai](mailto:steve@pioneerdev.ai).
