# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

3. Start the app on web

```bash
    npx expo start
```

- then press W in terminal

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Key Observations:

Fetching Data: You're using the useEffect hook to fetch movies when the component mounts, which is a great approach for handling side effects like data fetching.

State Management: You're using the useState hook to store the list of trending movies and conditionally render the FlatList.

Navigation: You're using the expo-router to navigate to a movie detail screen, passing along the movie data as params, which is a good pattern.

UI Layout: The FlatList is properly set up for a grid layout with numColumns={2}, and you've handled the empty state with ListEmptyComponent.

Styling: The styles are clean, and the columnWrapperStyle helps with the spacing between items.

Suggestions for Improvement or Considerations:
Error Handling: It would be beneficial to add some error handling in the getMovies function in case the API request fails. For example, a try-catch block can catch any potential errors, and you can show a fallback UI (e.g., an error message).

Loading State: You might want to add a loading state while the movies are being fetched. This will enhance the user experience when the data is still being loaded.

Performance Optimization: If the list of movies can be large, consider using React.memo or optimizing re-renders within MovieCard, especially if it's a more complex component.

Navigation Consistency: In onPress, youâ€™re passing a stringified version of the item. While this works, if the movie data is already passed correctly as a parameter, it might be unnecessary to stringify it. You could pass it directly or ensure that you're using the correct type in the navigation params.

## Observations:

Layout & Design:

You are using a linear gradient over the movie poster, which is a nice touch to enhance the UI.

The layout is easy to follow, with clear sections for the movie poster, details, and similar movies.

State Management:

Youâ€™re managing multiple states like similarMovies, movie, videoKey, and visible, which are all appropriately handled.

Error Handling:

While the API requests are properly structured, consider adding error handling (e.g., try-catch blocks) around the API calls (fetchMovieDetails, fetchSimilarMovies, fetchVideoMovies) to handle any network or server errors gracefully.

UI Enhancements:

A loading spinner could be added while waiting for the API data to load, improving the user experience, especially on slower networks.

Performance Optimization:

If the fetchMovieDetails, fetchSimilarMovies, and fetchVideoMovies functions are fetching large amounts of data, you could optimize the rendering by using techniques like lazy loading for images or using React.memo for components that don't need to re-render on every state change.
